            Hey there, glad you're taking a look at that website! <br>
            That thing you're looking at right now is mainly a way for me to try out what I've learned so far, <br>
            so don't wonder if you come back some time and the website looks completely different.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyway, feel free to wonder around, everything on the webpage is mainly about me and what I'm doing in my life.
        </p>

            More content will follow soon ðŸ˜„
